# Transcribers

A framework for writing lists of rules to transform text.

Primarily based around Regular Expressions, there is also support for creating stateful transcribers.

Initially developed as part of [IPA-Transcribers](https://github.com/kotlinguistics/IPA-Transcribers),
but can be used for other purposes.
